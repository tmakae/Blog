An AI chatbot is a software application that engages in human conversation in a natural way.

AI chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) to help users to interact with web services or apps through text, graphics, or speech. Chatbots can understand natural human language, emulate human conversation, and run simple, automated tasks. In addition, AI chatbots use predictive intelligence and analytics to learn a user’s preferences and use this knowledge to provide recommendations and anticipate needs.

To work effectively, AI chatbots must be able translate human speech and language into something that a computer can understand. The process of understanding, analyzing, and responding to human speech is a complex task, which we call natural language processing.

Natural language processing works by breaking down user inputs into utterances, intents, and entries. An utterance is any phrase that a user enters into a chatbot. When an utterance is entered into a chatbot, the chatbot determines the intent of the utterance—the user’s goal in contacting the chatbot. Finally, the chatbot recognizes entities within the utterance that help define the details of the intent. Entities are typically things like dates, times, places, names, or locations that provide further specificity to a user’s intent.

## H2 Transactional chatbots
A transactional chatbot, also called a task-oriented or declarative chatbot, is a single-purpose chatbot that’s focused on performing or automating one function. It uses rules, natural language processing, and a very small amount of machine learning. A transactional chatbot is trained on structured data and designed to provide a fixed set of options for a user to choose from, depending on what the user wants to do or what problem they want to solve. After the user makes their choice, the chatbot guides them through the process by providing more options until the user’s question has been answered or the problem has been solved.

## H2 Conversational chatbots
A conversational chatbot is a more sophisticated and interactive type of AI chatbot for more personalized interactions. It’s designed to use conversational AI to understand meaning in the user’s messages and respond in a way that’s humanlike. Conversational chatbots use artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and access to knowledge databases and other information to detect nuances in a user’s questions and responses, then give relevant answers the way a human would. These AI chatbots are contextually aware and use natural language understanding, natural language processing, and machine learning to become progressively smarter.

Conversational chatbots, which are often called virtual assistants or digital assistants, also use predictive intelligence and analytics for personalization based on each user’s profile and previous behavior. Over time, this type of AI chatbot can learn a user’s preferences and use this learning to provide recommendations and anticipate needs. Conversational chatbots are used by ecommerce companies, online services, social platforms, businesses with advanced software as a service (SaaS) tools, and business-to-business (B2B) companies that provide enterprise solutions.
